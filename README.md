# stock_price_Prediction-GS

This project predicts stock prices using multiple deep learning models such as LSTM, GRU, and a hybrid ensemble model that integrates predictions from both models.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains the historical stock price data.
- **models/**: Holds the code for each model (LSTM, GRU, and ensemble).
- **networks/**: Defines the architecture for each network.
- **utils/**: Utility functions for data preprocessing, evaluation, and visualization.
- **results/**: Stores the prediction results.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebook for visualization and data analysis.
- **test/**: Scripts to test model predictions.
- **streamlit_app.py**: A Streamlit app for interactive model usage.

## Features

- **LSTM Model**: Captures long-term dependencies in time-series data.
- **GRU Model**: Similar to LSTM but with fewer parameters, making it faster for some datasets.
- **Ensemble Model**: Combines predictions from LSTM and GRU for potentially better performance.
- **Streamlit Web App**: Provides an interactive interface for visualizing actual vs. predicted stock prices.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Includes comprehensive visualizations and step-by-step analysis.
- **Unit Testing**: Ensures the accuracy of model predictions via Mean Squared Error (MSE).
